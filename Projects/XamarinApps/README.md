# XamarinApps

This folder is reserved for Xamarin / MAUI sample apps. Creating a full Xamarin app requires platform SDKs; for tutorials you can use the `.NET` sample in the parent folder which is lighter and suitable for CI build/test demonstrations.

To create a new MAUI app locally:

```
dotnet new maui -n SampleMaui
```
